# Personal Project Portfolio

Since I'm creating this project after the completion of the Bootcamp I've decided to stray just slightly from the README and build a single page portfolio using two technologies that I have heard a lot about outside the course, GatsbyJS and Netlify to deploy. I also have to credit the Gatsby starter template library for giving me a start to the project and helping me to quickly produce a nice looking portfolio. [This](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio) is the one I chose to use for this project.

I found the template to not only speed up my development process, but also reading and working with another, more experienced person's React code and seeing their file structure, etc. was a nice learning experience.
